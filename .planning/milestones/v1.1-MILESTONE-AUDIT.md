# Milestone v1.1 Audit: WebUI Runtime Dashboard

**Audited:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** tech_debt — All requirements satisfied, no critical blockers, documentation debt needs review
**Phases:** 5/5 complete (03 → 04 → 05 → 06 → 07)

## Requirements Coverage (13/13)

### 3-Source Cross-Reference

| REQ-ID | Description | Phase | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-------------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| INFRA-01 | Runtime launches as Blazor Server app | 3 | SATISFIED | missing | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| INFRA-02 | State changes push via SignalR | 5 | COVERED | missing | [ ] Pending | **satisfied** (checkbox stale) |
| INFRA-03 | Auto-launches browser on startup | 3 | SATISFIED | missing | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| MOD-06 | View loaded modules with status | 4 | SATISFIED | missing | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| MOD-07 | View module metadata | 4 | SATISFIED | missing | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| MOD-08 | Load module from dashboard | 6 | SATISFIED | missing | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| MOD-09 | Unload module from dashboard | 6 | SATISFIED | missing | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| MOD-10 | Error message on failure | 6 | SATISFIED | missing | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| BEAT-01 | View heartbeat running state | 5 | COVERED | missing | [ ] Pending | **satisfied** (checkbox stale) |
| BEAT-02 | Start/stop heartbeat | 6 | SATISFIED | missing | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| BEAT-03 | Live tick counter | 5 | COVERED | missing | [ ] Pending | **satisfied** (checkbox stale) |
| BEAT-04 | Per-tick latency with warning | 5 | COVERED | missing | [ ] Pending | **satisfied** (checkbox stale) |
| UI-01 | Responsive layout | 4 | SATISFIED | missing | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |

**Note:** All SUMMARY files lack `requirements-completed` frontmatter (documentation gap). VERIFICATION.md provides detailed evidence for all 13 requirements. 4 REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes stale (Phase 5 items marked Pending but verified as COVERED).

### Orphaned Requirements

None. All 13 requirements appear in at least one phase VERIFICATION.md with evidence.

## Phase Verification Summary (5/5 passed)

| Phase | Name | Status | Score | Requirements |
|-------|------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 03 | Service Abstraction & Hosting | passed | 4/4 criteria | INFRA-01, INFRA-03 |
| 04 | Blazor UI with Static Display | passed | 12/12 must-haves | MOD-06, MOD-07, UI-01 |
| 05 | SignalR Real-Time Updates | passed | 4/4 criteria | INFRA-02, BEAT-01, BEAT-03, BEAT-04 |
| 06 | Control Operations | passed | 11/11 must-haves | MOD-08, MOD-09, MOD-10, BEAT-02 |
| 07 | Polish & Validation | passed | 7/7 must-haves | (polish — no new requirements) |

## Integration Check (13/13 wired, 6/6 flows)

### Cross-Phase Wiring

- **15 exports** properly connected across phases
- **0 orphaned** exports (created but unused)
- **0 missing** connections
- **5/5 Hub RPC methods** consumed by UI
- **3/3 SignalR push events** have producers and consumers

### E2E Flows

| # | Flow | Requirements | Status |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Startup & Browser Launch | INFRA-01, INFRA-03 | COMPLETE |
| 2 | View Loaded Modules | MOD-06, MOD-07 | COMPLETE |
| 3 | Load Module from Dashboard | MOD-08, MOD-10 | COMPLETE |
| 4 | Unload Module from Dashboard | MOD-09, MOD-10 | COMPLETE |
| 5 | Start/Stop Heartbeat | BEAT-01, BEAT-02 | COMPLETE |
| 6 | Real-Time Monitoring | INFRA-02, BEAT-03, BEAT-04 | COMPLETE |

## Tech Debt

3. ROADMAP.md Plan 07-02 checkbox still shows `[ ]`
4. No SUMMARY files contain `requirements-completed` YAML frontmatter
5. REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table shows "Pending" for 4 completed requirements

# Requirements: OpenAnima

**Defined:** 2026-02-22
**Core Value:** Agents that proactively think and act on their own, while module connections remain deterministic and safe

## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for WebUI Runtime Dashboard milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Infrastructure

- [x] **INFRA-01**: Runtime launches as Blazor Server app serving a web-based monitoring dashboard
- [x] **INFRA-02**: Runtime state changes push to browser in real-time via SignalR without manual refresh
- [x] **INFRA-03**: Runtime auto-launches default browser to dashboard URL on startup

### Module Monitoring

- [x] **MOD-06**: User can view a list of all loaded modules with status indicators (loaded/error)
- [x] **MOD-07**: User can view each module's metadata (name, version, description, author)
- [x] **MOD-08**: User can load a new module via file picker from the dashboard
- [x] **MOD-09**: User can unload a loaded module via button click from the dashboard
- [x] **MOD-10**: User sees error message when a module operation fails

### Heartbeat Monitoring

- [x] **BEAT-01**: User can view heartbeat loop running state (Running/Stopped)
- [x] **BEAT-02**: User can start and stop the heartbeat loop from the dashboard
- [x] **BEAT-03**: User can see a live tick counter updating in real-time
- [x] **BEAT-04**: User can see per-tick latency with warning when exceeding 100ms target

### User Interface

- [x] **UI-01**: Dashboard layout adapts to different screen sizes (responsive)

## v1.2+ Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Advanced Monitoring

- **EVNT-01**: User can view real-time event bus activity (event types, timestamps, source modules)
- **EVNT-02**: User can view module dependency relationships as a tree/graph
- **BEAT-05**: User can view heartbeat tick history as a line chart (last 100 ticks)
- **MOD-11**: User can view module load/unload history timeline

### Desktop Polish

- **DESK-01**: Dark mode toggle with persisted preference
- **DESK-02**: System tray integration with minimize-to-tray and context menu

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Module configuration editor | Each module has different config schema, generic editor is complex — use appsettings.json |
| Real-time event payload inspection | Privacy concern, performance impact, UI clutter — show types/counts only |
| Module code editor | Scope creep into IDE territory — use VS Code/Visual Studio |
| Historical data persistence | Database complexity, storage growth — current session only |
| Multi-runtime management | Networking complexity, authentication — single runtime only |
| Module marketplace integration | Marketplace doesn't exist yet — manual file picker |
| Custom dashboard layouts | Complexity explosion — fixed well-designed layout |
| Alerting/notifications | Notification infrastructure complexity — user monitors actively |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| INFRA-01 | Phase 3 | Complete |
| INFRA-02 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| INFRA-03 | Phase 3 | Complete |
| MOD-06 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| MOD-07 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| MOD-08 | Phase 6 | Complete |
| MOD-09 | Phase 6 | Complete |
| MOD-10 | Phase 6 | Complete |
| BEAT-01 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| BEAT-02 | Phase 6 | Complete |
| BEAT-03 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| BEAT-04 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| UI-01 | Phase 4 | Complete |

# Milestone v1.3 Audit Report: True Modularization & Visual Wiring

**Audited:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** tech_debt
**Note:** All requirements verified, but Phase 19 execution pending and metadata drift remains.

## Scope

In-scope phases: 11, 12, 12.5, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Verification file | Status | Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | 11-VERIFICATION.md | passed | 5/5 truths |
| 12 | 12-VERIFICATION.md | passed | 4/4 truths |
| 12.5 | 12.5-VERIFICATION.md | passed | 18/18 truths |
| 13 | 13-VERIFICATION.md | passed | 6/6 truths |
| 14 | 14-VERIFICATION.md | passed | 4/4 truths |
| 15 | 15-VERIFICATION.md | passed | 4/4 truths |
| 16 | 16-VERIFICATION.md | passed | 4/4 truths |
| 17 | 17-VERIFICATION.md | passed | 5/5 truths |
| 18 | 18-VERIFICATION.md | passed | 4/4 truths |
| 19 | **missing** | unverified | 0/0 (planned) |

Phase score: **9/10** verified (Phase 19 has plan but not executed).

## 3-Source Requirements Cross-Reference

Matrix used: VERIFICATION + SUMMARY frontmatter (`requirements-completed`) + REQUIREMENTS checkbox state.

### Satisfied (20/20)

All v1.3 requirements have verification evidence:

| REQ-ID | Verification evidence | Summary listed | REQ.md checkbox | Final |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PORT-01 | passed (Ph11) | [] | [x] | satisfied |
| PORT-02 | passed (Ph11) | [] | [x] | satisfied |
| PORT-03 | passed (Ph11) | [] | [x] | satisfied |
| PORT-04 | passed (Ph11, Ph12.5, Ph16) | [] | [ ] | satisfied (checkbox drift) |
| WIRE-01 | passed (Ph12, Ph12.5, Ph15) | [] | [x] | satisfied |
| WIRE-02 | passed (Ph12, Ph12.5) | [] | [x] | satisfied |
| WIRE-03 | passed (Ph12, Ph12.5, Ph15) | [] | [x] | satisfied |
| EDIT-01 | passed (Ph13, Ph16) | [] | [ ] | satisfied (checkbox drift) |
| EDIT-02 | passed (Ph13) | [] | [x] | satisfied |
| EDIT-03 | passed (Ph13) | [] | [x] | satisfied |
| EDIT-04 | passed (Ph13) | [] | [x] | satisfied |
| EDIT-05 | passed (Ph13, Ph15) | [] | [x] | satisfied |
| EDIT-06 | passed (Ph13) | [] | [x] | satisfied |
| RMOD-01 | passed (Ph14, Ph16, Ph18) | [] | [ ] | satisfied (checkbox drift) |
| RMOD-02 | passed (Ph14, Ph16, Ph18) | [] | [ ] | satisfied (checkbox drift) |
| RMOD-03 | passed (Ph14, Ph16, Ph18) | [] | [ ] | satisfied (checkbox drift) |
| RMOD-04 | passed (Ph14, Ph16, Ph18) | [] | [ ] | satisfied (checkbox drift) |
| RTIM-01 | passed (Ph14, Ph17) | [] | [x] | satisfied |
| RTIM-02 | passed (Ph14, Ph17) | [] | [x] | satisfied |
| E2E-01 | passed (Ph12.5, Ph17) | [] | [x] | satisfied |

**Orphaned Requirements:** None — Phase 18 backfill resolved all RMOD orphan gaps.

## Integration Check (Cross-Phase Wiring + E2E)

Integration evidence checked:
- All 9 phase verification artifacts
- Cross-phase export/import map
- E2E flow verification

### Cross-Phase Integration

**Connected:** 18 exports properly used across phases
**Orphaned:** 0 exports created but unused
**Missing:** 0 expected connections not found

All integration chains verified:
1. Port System Foundation (Ph11 → Ph12/12.5/13/14/16)
2. Wiring Engine Orchestration (Ph12/12.5 → Ph13/15/16/17)
3. Module Pipeline (Ph14/16 → Ph17)
4. Runtime Status (Ph14/17 → Editor UI)

### E2E Flow Status

| Flow | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| ChatInput -> LLM -> ChatOutput conversation | pass | Phase 17 verification + passing integration tests |
| Runtime status/error pushed to editor nodes | pass | Phase 17 verification + passing integration tests |
| Incompatible connection rejection feedback | pass | Phase 17 verification + EditorStateService tests |
| Save/load wiring round-trip | pass | Phase 15 verification (round-trip test) |
| Auto-load on startup after restart | pass | Phase 15 code verification + Phase 16 initialization flow |
| Startup concrete module registration/init | pass | Phase 16 verification + passing tests |

Flow score: **6/6** complete.

## Phase 18 Gap Closure Verification

Phase 18 successfully closed the v1.3 milestone gaps:

1. **14-VERIFICATION.md** created with:
   - 4 observable truths verified
   - RMOD-01..04 requirements coverage table
   - Automated test evidence (8 tests passed)

2. **16-VERIFICATION.md** created with:
   - 4 observable truths verified
   - RMOD-01..04 startup registration evidence
   - Automated test evidence (3 tests passed)

3. **RMOD orphan status resolved:**
   - RMOD-01..04 are no longer orphaned
   - Full evidence chain: Phase 14 implementation → Phase 16 startup → Phase 18 backfill

## Tech Debt / Deferred Items

### Phase 19 Execution Pending

Phase 19 was planned but not executed:
- `19-01-PLAN.md` exists with objective to remove invalid `WIRE-04`/`WIRE-05` from 14-03-SUMMARY.md
- No SUMMARY.md or VERIFICATION.md for Phase 19

**Note:** This is a metadata cleanup phase with no code changes. The invalid IDs were identified in the prior audit.

### REQUIREMENTS.md Checkbox Drift

5 requirements have `[ ]` checkbox but verified evidence:
- PORT-04 (verified in Ph11, Ph12.5, Ph16)
- EDIT-01 (verified in Ph13, Ph16)
- RMOD-01, RMOD-02, RMOD-03, RMOD-04 (verified in Ph14, Ph16, Ph18)

### Summary Frontmatter Gaps

Most summaries have empty `requirements-completed: []` arrays despite passed verification:
- Phase 11 summaries: all empty
- Phase 12 summaries: all empty
- Phase 12.5 summaries: all empty
- Phase 13 summaries: all empty
- Phase 15 summary: empty
- Phase 16 summary: empty
- Phase 17 summaries: all empty

This causes requirements to appear "partial" under strict 3-source cross-reference, though VERIFICATION evidence confirms satisfaction.

## Test Results Summary

All verification tests passing:

**Phase 11:** 20/20 tests (11 unit + 9 integration)
**Phase 12:** 28/28 tests (21 unit + 7 integration)
**Phase 12.5:** 11/11 integration tests
**Phase 13:** 12/12 unit tests
**Phase 14:** 8/8 tests (module + pipeline integration)
**Phase 15:** 14/14 ConfigurationLoader tests
**Phase 16:** 3/3 integration tests
**Phase 17:** 24/24 tests (chat pipeline + runtime status + editor state)

## Audit Conclusion

Milestone v1.3 is **ready for completion** with tech debt notes.

**All 20 requirements verified with evidence.** No blockers remain:
- No orphaned requirements
- No broken integration chains
- No failed E2E flows
- Phase 18 backfill resolved prior RMOD orphan gap

**Tech debt to track in backlog:**
1. Execute Phase 19 (metadata cleanup)
2. Update REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes for PORT-04, EDIT-01, RMOD-01..04
3. Backfill summary frontmatter requirements-completed arrays

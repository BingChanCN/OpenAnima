# v1.2 LLM Integration — Milestone Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** gaps_found
**Score:** 5/16 requirements satisfied

## Milestone Definition of Done

From ROADMAP.md: v1.2 LLM Integration encompasses Phases 8-10, covering LLM API client, chat UI with streaming, and context management with token counting.

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Name | Status | Verification | Requirements |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 8 | API Client Setup & Configuration | ✓ Complete | passed (9/9 truths) | 5/5 satisfied |
| 9 | Chat UI with Streaming | ✗ Not started | missing | 0/7 |
| 10 | Context Management & Token Counting | ✗ Not started | missing | 0/4 |

## Requirements Cross-Reference (3-Source)

### Phase 8 — LLM API Client (All Satisfied)

| REQ-ID | Description | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| LLM-01 | Configure LLM endpoint, API key, model via appsettings.json | ✓ SATISFIED | Listed in 08-01 | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| LLM-02 | Call OpenAI-compatible chat completion API | ✓ SATISFIED | Listed in 08-01 | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| LLM-03 | Streaming responses token-by-token | ✓ SATISFIED | Covered in 08-02 | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| LLM-04 | Meaningful error messages on API failures | ✓ SATISFIED | Listed in 08-01 | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| LLM-05 | Retry transient failures with exponential backoff | ✓ SATISFIED | Listed in 08-01, 08-02 | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |

### Phase 9 — Chat UI (All Unsatisfied)

| REQ-ID | Description | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| CHAT-01 | Send text messages from chat panel | missing | missing | [ ] Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| CHAT-02 | Conversation history with role-based styling | missing | missing | [ ] Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| CHAT-03 | Streaming LLM responses in real-time UI | missing | missing | [ ] Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| CHAT-04 | Chat auto-scroll | missing | missing | [ ] Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| CHAT-05 | Copy message to clipboard | missing | missing | [ ] Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| CHAT-06 | Regenerate last assistant response | missing | missing | [ ] Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| CHAT-07 | Markdown-formatted responses with code highlighting | missing | missing | [ ] Pending | **unsatisfied** |

### Phase 10 — Context Management (All Unsatisfied)

| REQ-ID | Description | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| CTX-01 | Token counting per message | missing | missing | [ ] Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| CTX-02 | Auto-truncate oldest messages at context limit | missing | missing | [ ] Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| CTX-03 | Show token usage and remaining capacity | missing | missing | [ ] Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| CTX-04 | Chat events published to EventBus | missing | missing | [ ] Pending | **unsatisfied** |

**Orphaned Requirements:** None — all 16 requirements assigned to phases in traceability table.

## Integration Check Results

**Phase 8 Internal Wiring:** Complete — all services registered in DI, configuration bound, error handling wired.

**Cross-Phase Integration:**
- Phase 8 exports (ILLMService, ChatClient, LLMOptions) are registered and ready for consumption
- No consumers exist yet — Phase 9 (Chat UI) has not been started
- Phase 10 (Context Management) depends on Phase 9

**E2E Flows:** No user-facing flows can be verified — Phase 8 is backend-only. E2E flows require Phase 9 Chat UI.

**Build Status:** ✓ Success (0 warnings, 0 errors)

## Tech Debt

No tech debt detected in Phase 8:
- No TODO/FIXME/PLACEHOLDER comments
- No stubs or NotImplementedException
- No anti-patterns found
- Clean build with no warnings

## Conclusion

Phase 8 (API Client) is fully complete and verified. However, the v1.2 milestone requires Phases 9 and 10 to be planned and executed before the milestone definition of done can be achieved. 11 of 16 requirements remain unsatisfied.

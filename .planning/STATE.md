## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 7-phase structure derived from requirement dependencies (Plugin System → Event Bus → LLM → Thinking Loop → Visual Editor → Persistence → Runtime Controls)
- Roadmap: Phase 5 (Visual Editor) flagged as HIGH RISK due to Blazor.Diagrams maturity concerns from research
- [Phase 01]: Use .slnx format (XML-based solution) instead of traditional .sln - .NET 10 SDK creates .slnx by default

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5: Blazor.Diagrams maturity unknown, needs early prototype validation with fallback to Electron + React Flow if needed

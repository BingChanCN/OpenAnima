# Milestone v1.3 Audit: True Modularization & Visual Wiring

**Audited:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** gaps_found
**Score:** 7/20 requirements satisfied

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Status | Verification | Requirements |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 11 | Port Type System & Testing Foundation | Complete | passed (5/5) | PORT-01 through PORT-04 |
| 12 | Wiring Engine & Execution Orchestration | Complete | passed (4/4) | WIRE-01 through WIRE-03 |
| 13 | Visual Drag-and-Drop Editor | Not started | — | EDIT-01 through EDIT-06 |
| 14 | Module Refactoring & Runtime Integration | Not started | — | RMOD-01 through RMOD-04, RTIM-01, RTIM-02, E2E-01 |

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Satisfied (7/20)

| REQ-ID | Description | Phase | VERIFICATION | REQUIREMENTS.md |
|--------|-------------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| PORT-01 | Port type categories with visual color distinction | 11 | passed | [x] |
| PORT-02 | Incompatible port type rejection | 11 | passed | [x] |
| PORT-03 | Fan-out (one output to multiple inputs) | 11 | passed | [x] |
| PORT-04 | Typed port declaration, discoverable at load time | 11 | passed | [x] |
| WIRE-01 | Topological execution order | 12 | passed | [x] |
| WIRE-02 | Circular dependency detection and rejection | 12 | passed | [x] |
| WIRE-03 | Data routing between connected ports | 12 | passed | [x] |

### Unsatisfied (13/20) — Phases Not Started

| REQ-ID | Description | Phase | Status |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| EDIT-01 | Drag modules from palette onto canvas | 13 | Not started |
| EDIT-02 | Pan canvas and zoom with mouse wheel | 13 | Not started |
| EDIT-03 | Drag-to-connect with bezier curve preview | 13 | Not started |
| EDIT-04 | Select and delete nodes/connections | 13 | Not started |
| EDIT-05 | Save/load wiring configuration as JSON | 13 | Not started |
| EDIT-06 | Auto-save after changes | 13 | Not started |
| RMOD-01 | LLMModule with typed ports | 14 | Not started |
| RMOD-02 | ChatInputModule with output port | 14 | Not started |
| RMOD-03 | ChatOutputModule with input port | 14 | Not started |
| RMOD-04 | HeartbeatModule with trigger port | 14 | Not started |

| RTIM-02 | Module error visual indicators | 14 | Not started |
| E2E-01 | ChatInput→LLM→ChatOutput working conversation | 14 | Not started |

## Cross-Phase Integration

### Verified Connections (Phase 11 → 12)

| Export | From | Used By | Status |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| ConnectionGraph.GetExecutionLevels() | 12-01 | WiringEngine (12-03) | WIRED |
| PortRegistry.GetPorts() | 11-01 | ConfigurationLoader (12-02) | WIRED |
| PortTypeValidator.ValidateConnection() | 11-01 | ConfigurationLoader (12-02) | WIRED |
| EventBus.Subscribe/PublishAsync() | pre-existing | WiringEngine (12-03) | WIRED |
| PortDiscovery.DiscoverPorts() | 11-01 | Modules.razor (11-03) | WIRED |
| PortColors.GetHex() | 11-03 | PortIndicator.razor (11-03) | WIRED |

### Integration Gaps (Runtime)

| Component | Issue | Affected Requirements |
|-----------|-------|-----------------------|
| WiringEngine | Not registered in DI — only works in tests | WIRE-01, WIRE-02, WIRE-03, E2E-01 |
| ConfigurationLoader | Not registered in DI — Phase 13 save/load blocked | EDIT-05, EDIT-06 |
| PortRegistry | Never populated at runtime — discovery is ephemeral | PORT-04, WIRE-02, EDIT-03 |

### Broken Flows

| Flow | Break Point | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Module Load → Port Registration | PortDiscovery result not persisted to PortRegistry | Phase 13 editor cannot query available ports |
| Config Save/Load → Execution | No DI registration, no runtime bridge | WIRE requirements only work in tests |

## Tech Debt (7 items across 2 phases)

**Phase 11:** PortRegistry not in DI, ephemeral port discovery, missing SUMMARY frontmatter field
**Phase 12:** WiringEngine not in DI, ConfigurationLoader not in DI, 2 pre-existing perf test failures, missing SUMMARY frontmatter field

## Test Results

| Phase | Unit | Integration | Total |
|-------|------|-------------|-------|
| 11 | 11/11 | 9/9 | 20/20 |
| 12 | 21/21 | 7/7 | 28/28 |
| **Total** | **32/32** | **16/16** | **48/48** |

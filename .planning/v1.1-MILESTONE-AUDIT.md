# Milestone v1.1 Audit: WebUI Runtime Dashboard

**Audited:** 2026-02-22T13:35:41Z
**Status:** gaps_found
**Reason:** Phase 7 (Polish & Validation) is in milestone scope but not started

## Requirements Coverage (13/13)

All v1.1 requirements verified as satisfied across their assigned phases.

| REQ-ID | Description | Phase | VERIFICATION | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final |
|--------|-------------|-------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| INFRA-01 | Blazor Server app | 3 | passed | [x] Complete | satisfied |
| INFRA-02 | SignalR real-time push | 5 | passed | [ ] Pending* | satisfied |
| INFRA-03 | Browser auto-launch | 3 | passed | [x] Complete | satisfied |
| MOD-06 | Module list with status | 4 | passed | [x] Complete | satisfied |
| MOD-07 | Module metadata view | 4 | passed | [x] Complete | satisfied |
| MOD-08 | Load module from dashboard | 6 | passed | [x] Complete | satisfied |
| MOD-09 | Unload module from dashboard | 6 | passed | [x] Complete | satisfied |
| MOD-10 | Error message on failure | 6 | passed | [x] Complete | satisfied |
| BEAT-01 | Heartbeat running state | 5 | passed | [ ] Pending* | satisfied |
| BEAT-02 | Start/stop heartbeat | 6 | passed | [x] Complete | satisfied |
| BEAT-03 | Live tick counter | 5 | passed | [ ] Pending* | satisfied |
| BEAT-04 | Per-tick latency warning | 5 | passed | [ ] Pending* | satisfied |
| UI-01 | Responsive layout | 4 | passed | [x] Complete | satisfied |

*Stale checkbox — VERIFICATION.md confirms these are satisfied.

**Orphaned requirements:** None. All 13 REQ-IDs present in at least one VERIFICATION.md.

## Phase Completion (4/5)

| Phase | Name | Status | Verification |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| 3 | Service Abstraction & Hosting | Complete | passed (4/4 criteria) |
| 4 | Blazor UI with Static Display | Complete | passed (12/12 truths) |
| 5 | SignalR Real-Time Updates | Complete | passed (4/4 criteria) |
| 6 | Control Operations | Complete | passed (11/11 truths) |
| 7 | Polish & Validation | **NOT STARTED** | **no verification** |

### Phase 7 Gap Detail

Phase 7 is defined in ROADMAP.md (lines 96-106) as part of v1.1 with 5 success criteria:
1. Loading states and spinners during async operations
2. Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
3. Connection status indicator for SignalR circuit health
4. Memory leak testing (100 connect/disconnect cycles)
5. Performance validation (20+ modules, sustained operation)

**Note:** Some Phase 7 criteria may already be partially met by Phase 6 work (loading states exist on buttons). Full validation requires Phase 7 execution.

## Cross-Phase Integration (13/13)

All 13 requirements properly wired across phases. Integration checker verified:
- **23 connected exports** across phases
- **6/6 E2E flows complete**, 0 broken
- **5/5 Hub RPC methods** have callers (100%)
- **0 missing connections**

### E2E Flows Verified

| Flow | Requirements | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Module Load Operation | MOD-08 | Complete |
| Module Unload Operation | MOD-09 | Complete |
| Heartbeat Start/Stop | BEAT-02 | Complete |
| Real-Time Tick Display | BEAT-03, BEAT-04 | Complete |
| Module Detail Modal | MOD-07 | Complete |
| Dashboard Summary | UI-01, MOD-06, BEAT-01 | Complete |

## Tech Debt

### Phase 5: SignalR Real-Time Updates
- `IHeartbeatService.LastTickLatencyMs` exposed but unused (SignalR push used instead)
- `IHeartbeatService.SkippedCount` not visualized in UI (logged on shutdown only)

### Phase 6: Control Operations
- `PluginRegistry.GetEntry()` defined but never called
- `PluginRegistry.GetModule()` defined but never called

### Process
- REQUIREMENTS.md traceability has 4 stale "Pending" entries that should be "Complete"
- No SUMMARY.md files contain `requirements-completed` frontmatter field

**Total: 6 items across 3 categories** — all non-blocking
